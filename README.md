# Clusturing-wholesale-data-with-k-means-algorithm

This data downloaded this wholesale customer dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The dataset refers to clients of a wholesale distributor. 
It includes the annual spending in monetary units on diverse product categories.

Our goal  is to use k-means clustering techniques to segment customers.
Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that tries to cluster data based on their similarity. 
Thus, there is no outcome to be predicted, and the algorithm just tries to find patterns in the data.
