# Clusturing-wholesale-data-with-k-means-algorithm

This data downloaded this wholesale customer dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. <br />
The dataset refers to clients of a wholesale distributor. <br />
It includes the annual spending in monetary units on diverse product categories.<br />

Our goal  is to use k-means clustering techniques to segment customers.<br />
Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that tries to cluster data based on their similarity. <br />
Thus, there is no outcome to be predicted, and the algorithm just tries to find patterns in the data.<br />
